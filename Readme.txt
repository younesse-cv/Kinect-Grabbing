Description: This project displays grabs the kinect rgb and depth streams. 
I used to display those streams opencv library that you can find here:
http://opencv.org/downloads.html
Also you need to install openni and Kinect drivers. Visit this website and follow steps to install:
http://www.openni.org/ 

This code can be useful for people who want to figure out and control the Kinect data, to apply some operations using Opencv functions, such as projection, segmentation, save frames, etc.
Enjoy!
